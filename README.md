# CS370
Project repository for Current and Emerging Trends (CS-370)
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
We were given all of the code except for the one #TODO Section. In that section, everything prior to the #pseuedocode and all of the comments after that are there currently were provided to help guide us to making the required code. The comments allowed me to understand what the code needed to achieve. The goal was to create the "agent" for the game and develop the possible actions the agent could take.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
CS is a very broad area. CS involves Networking and Coding which, I believe, are the two main areas. Computer Sciences allow us to develop programs that can help us complete repeatable tasks, and create video games that allow us to have fun while also acting as a reward/goal system. It also helps keep some of the tasks that require Personal information to remain secure and reduces the risk of important data getting into the hands of nefarious people.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
In general, I like to approach problems in steps. I assess the requirements to solve the problem. Plan out how to solve the problem, incorporating big steps in order to finish. Then I execute the plan and adjust when additional problems arise. This helps keep the plan on track.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities of a developer are similar to those of the Hippocratic Oath that medical personnel take. In short, to do no wrong. This means that whatever data needs to be input must be secure and the uses of that data should be openly stated. When working for an organization, we also have a responsibility to not steal or represent the company in a bad light.
